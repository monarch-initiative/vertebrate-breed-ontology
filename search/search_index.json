Everyone is welcome and encouraged to submit an issue: all that is required is a GitHub account, which can be created for free here . New term requests When a breed term cannot be found in VBO, one can submit a request to add it. A good term request includes: - the most common name for the breed (required ) - the species of the breed (required ) - any synonyms for the breed name - any publication (e.g. PMID), references, and/or databases supporting the information (required*) - the ORCID of the requester (so we can give you credit in the ontology) Please note that bulk submissions (i.e. requesting more than one term at a time) are welcome.

OMIA is hosted by the Sydney School of Veterinary Science (SSVS) within the University of Sydney. As OMIA developed over the past 26 years, breed names were entered as published in the papers reporting the phenes. Inevitably, the resultant OMIA list of breed names contains inconsistencies, duplications and errors. The ever-increasing inter-connectedness of the internet has highlighted the need for OMIA to adopt a standardised vocabulary for breeds that will enable OMIA to be reciprocally hyperlinked with other relevant internet resources. The Anstee Hub for Inherited Diseases of Animals (AHIDA) is a new initiative from the SSVS. Currently under development by the Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) in collaboration the AHIDA team, and with a projected launch in 2022, it will be a web resource for surveillance, reporting and control of inherited diseases in animals. As with OMIA, AHIDA requires a standardised vocabulary for breeds that will enable AHIDA to be reciprocally hyperlinked with other relevant internet resources. Inspired by the development of the Livestock Breed Ontology (LBO) by Zhiliang Hu, James Reecy and Cari Park at Iowa State University (ISU), the OMIA and AHIDA teams are collaborating with the SIH, with the instigators of the Monarch Initiative and some of their colleagues, and with the creators of LBO to create a breed ontology \u2015 a Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO) \u2015 that will include all the known breed names (including synonyms) for all species that are relevant to OMIA and AHIDA. By far the most comprehensive global resource for breeds is the list of breed names and synonyms compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in its Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DADIS) . A powerful attribute of DADIS is that its information is contributed and updated by designated National Coordinators from each of 182 countries. DADIS contains information on more than 15,000 national breed populations representing more than 8,800 breeds across 38 species. In collaboration with FAO colleagues responsible for DADIS (Roswitha Baumung and Gregoire Leroy), the VBO team is using the DADIS list of breed names and synonyms as the basis for the development of the VBO. Breed names and synonyms not included in the DADIS list, e.g. for cats, will be added to the VBO. OMIA breed names will then be mapped to VBO ids, as will LBO ids and ids or names from other relevant breed lists. Once developed, the VBO will be incorporated into OMIA and AHIDA, and will be made freely available. It is recognised that, as with the LBO, there will be a continual need for enhancement of the VBO.

It is used in databases such as OMIA and veterinarian health records to make non-human information more computable and consistent, therefore enhancing data interoperability. VBO is restricted to non-human vertebrate animal species. It covers breeds and breed populations for livestock, companion animals, and laboratory animals. What is a breed in VBO? Many definitions of 'breed' exist in the literature and in different communities. In VBO, a 'breed' is defined as: A taxonomic entity representing a population of vertebrate animals that share specific characteristics (such as traits, behavior, genetics) and/or for which cultural or geographical separation has led to the general acceptance of its separate identity. Breeds included in VBO have been characterized, defined, and determined by international breed organizations, communities, experts, and/or have been reported in the literature (see table below). VBO terms can be used in the same way that NCBITaxon are used.

AKC actively advocates for responsible dog ownership and is dedicated to advancing dog sports. Data breeds notes: The AKC standard for each breed originates with a \u201cparent club,\u201d the AKC-recognized national club devoted to a particular breed. Each breed\u2019s ideal physical traits, movement, and temperament are set down in a written document called a \u201cbreed standard.\u201d Once approved by the AKC, a standard becomes both the breeder\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d and the instrument used by dog show judges to evaluate a breeder\u2019s work. There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel Club recognizes 199 breeds, which are sorted into 9 groups: Sporting Group, Hound Group, Working Group, Terrier Group, Toy Group, Non-Sporting Group, Herding Group, Miscellaneous Class, and Foundation Stock Service. The Foundation Stock Service\u00ae allows purebred rare breeds to continue to develop while providing them with the security of a reliable and reputable avenue to maintain their records. Foundation Stock Service\u00ae is a requirement for fanciers of a breed who want to achieve full AKC recognition. FSS\u00ae breeds may now compete in Open Shows, Companion Events and Performance Events that AKC determines to be applicable. Breeds must have a breed standard in order to compete.The breeds currently eligible to participate in the Miscellaneous Class are still enrolled in the AKC Foundation Stock Service\u00ae. FSS\u00ae enrollment is maintained until the AKC Board of Directors accepts the breed for regular status. Authorities acknowledge that throughout the world there are several hundred distinct breeds of purebred dogs, not all of which are AKC recognized breeds. Those officially recognized for AKC registration appear in the Stud Book of the American Kennel Club. The AKC provides for a regular path of development for a new breed, which may result in that breed\u2019s full recognition and appearance in the official Stud Book as an AKC recognized breed.https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/ Data synchronization: The data in VBO coming from this source is currently not regularly updated.

United Kennel Club (UKC) Home page: https://www.ukcdogs.com/ Description: A Kalamazoo, Michigan-based company founded in 1898, United Kennel Club is the largest all-breed performance-dog registry in the world, registering dogs from all 50 states and 25 foreign countries. The UKC is an international registry and currently recognizes over 300 separate breeds. Data breeds notes: Each breed was developed for a specific purpose or function. The UKC standards contained herein are intended for use by people already familiar with the breeds they describe, such as responsible breeders and UKC judges. They are not intended for use by other organizations for breed identification and should not be adopted for those or similar purposes, either in part or as a whole. Each breed has its own breed standard. Breeds are assigned to one of 8 Groups based on its past and present function, historical origins and region of development: Companion Dog, Guardian Dog, Gun Dog, Herding Dog, Northern Breed, Scenthound, Sight and Pariah, and Terrier. Breed recognition is a significant landmark for a breed, in that it will become officially recognized by the world's largest performance dog registry. Full recognition entitles a breed to all the benefits of UKC, including, but not limited to, registration and participation in conformation and performance events licensed by the United Kennel Club. Therefore, the United Kennel Club prepared the following Breed Recognition Policies, all of which must be completed in order for a breed to be considered for recognition. Submission of this does not guarantee acceptance. The United Kennel Club does not consider a variation of an existing breed, or a result of a combination of two existing breeds, to be a new and unique breed. This includes, but is not limited to, differences in color, coat type, size or any disqualifications that may exist in the UKC Breed Standard for an existing breed. UKC reserves the right to refuse, correct or revoke any registration at any time. https://www.ukcdogs.com/breeds Data synchronization: The data in VBO coming from this source is currently not regularly updated. Veterinary Nomenclature (VeNom) Home page: https://venomcoding.org/ Description: The canine breed codes currently consist of breeds that are recognised by kennel clubs across the world. Where possible all synonyms of the same breed have been linked in the codes to each other, and are independent of their colour coding unless it is specific to that breed. Similar breeds have been grouped together using standard categories (e.g. Retrievers or Spaniels). The list is very inclusive to ensure all types of dog breeds are covered, and first generation pedigree crosses (such as Labradoodle or Puggle) are also included to assist with data capture. Non-standard cross breed dogs are recorded as synonyms of \u2018Crossbreed\u2019. https://venomcoding.org/venom-codes/ Data breeds notes: Note that not all dogs listed are recognized breeds by an official breed registry that can certify the dog is a purebred.

Data breeds notes: The AKC standard for each breed originates with a \u201cparent club,\u201d the AKC-recognized national club devoted to a particular breed. Each breed\u2019s ideal physical traits, movement, and temperament are set down in a written document called a \u201cbreed standard.\u201d Once approved by the AKC, a standard becomes both the breeder\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d and the instrument used by dog show judges to evaluate a breeder\u2019s work. There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel Club recognizes 199 breeds, which are sorted into 9 groups: Sporting Group, Hound Group, Working Group, Terrier Group, Toy Group, Non-Sporting Group, Herding Group, Miscellaneous Class, and Foundation Stock Service. The Foundation Stock Service\u00ae allows purebred rare breeds to continue to develop while providing them with the security of a reliable and reputable avenue to maintain their records. Foundation Stock Service\u00ae is a requirement for fanciers of a breed who want to achieve full AKC recognition. FSS\u00ae breeds may now compete in Open Shows, Companion Events and Performance Events that AKC determines to be applicable. Breeds must have a breed standard in order to compete.The breeds currently eligible to participate in the Miscellaneous Class are still enrolled in the AKC Foundation Stock Service\u00ae. FSS\u00ae enrollment is maintained until the AKC Board of Directors accepts the breed for regular status. Authorities acknowledge that throughout the world there are several hundred distinct breeds of purebred dogs, not all of which are AKC recognized breeds. Those officially recognized for AKC registration appear in the Stud Book of the American Kennel Club.

There are a few different editors workflows: Local editing workflow: Editing the ontology in your local environment by hand, using tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, ROBOT templates or DOSDP patterns. Completely automated data pipeline (GitHub Actions) DROID workflow This document only covers the first editing workflow, but more will be added in the future Local editing workflow Workflow requirements: git github docker editing tool of choice, e.g. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, your favourite text editor, etc 1. Create issue Ensure that there is a ticket on your issue tracker that describes the change you are about to make. While this seems optional, this is a very important part of the social contract of building an ontology - no change to the ontology should be performed without a good ticket, describing the motivation and nature of the intended change. 2. Update main branch In your local environment (e.g. your laptop), make sure you are on the main (prev. master ) branch and ensure that you have all the upstream changes, for example: git checkout master git pull 3. Create feature branch Create a new branch. Per convention, we try to use meaningful branch names such as: - issue23removeprocess (where issue 23 is the related issue on GitHub) - issue26addcontributor - release20210101 (for releases) On your command line, this looks like this: git checkout -b issue23removeprocess 4. Perform edit Using your editor of choice, perform the intended edit. For example: Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Open src/ontology/vbo-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Make the change Save the file TextEdit Open src/ontology/vbo-edit.owl in TextEdit (or Sublime, Atom, Vim, Nano) Make the change Save the file Consider the following when making the edit. According to our development philosophy, the only places that should be manually edited are: src/ontology/vbo-edit.owl Any ROBOT templates you chose to use (the TSV files only) Any DOSDP data tables you chose to use (the TSV files, and potentially the associated patterns) components (anything in src/ontology/components ), see here . Imports should not be edited (any edits will be flushed out with the next update). However, refreshing imports is a potentially breaking change - and is discussed elsewhere . Changes should usually be small. Adding or changing 1 term is great. Adding or changing 10 related terms is ok. Adding or changing 100 or more terms at once should be considered very carefully. 4. Check the Git diff This step is very important. Rather than simply trusting your change had the intended effect, we should always use a git diff as a first pass for sanity checking. In our experience, having a visual git client like GitHub Desktop or sourcetree is really helpful for this part. In case you prefer the command line: git status git diff 5. Quality control Now it's time to run your quality control checks. This can either happen locally ( 5a ) or through your continuous integration system ( 7/5b ). 5a. Local testing If you chose to run your test locally: sh run.sh make IMP=false test This will run the whole set of configured ODK tests on including your change. If you have a complex DOSDP pattern pipeline you may want to add PAT=false to skip the potentially lengthy process of rebuilding the patterns. sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false test 6. Pull request When you are happy with the changes, you commit your changes to your feature branch, push them upstream (to GitHub) and create a pull request. For example: git add NAMEOFCHANGEDFILES git commit -m \"Added biological process term #12\" git push -u origin issue23removeprocess Then you go to your project on GitHub, and create a new pull request from the branch, for example: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pulls There is a lot of great advise on how to write pull requests, but at the very least you should: - mention the tickets affected: see #23 to link to a related ticket, or fixes #23 if, by merging this pull request, the ticket is fixed. Tickets in the latter case will be closed automatically by GitHub when the pull request is merged. - summarise the changes in a few sentences. Consider the reviewer: what would they want to know right away. - If the diff is large, provide instructions on how to review the pull request best (sometimes, there are many changed files, but only one important change). 7/5b. Continuous Integration Testing If you didn't run and local quality control checks (see 5a ), you should have Continuous Integration (CI) set up, for example: - Travis - GitHub Actions More on how to set this up here . Once the pull request is created, the CI will automatically trigger. If all is fine, it will show up green, otherwise red. 8. Community review Once all the automatic tests have passed, it is important to put a second set of eyes on the pull request. Ontologies are inherently social - as in that they represent some kind of community consensus on how a domain is organised conceptually. This seems high brow talk, but it is very important that as an ontology editor, you have your work validated by the community you are trying to serve (e.g. your colleagues, other contributors etc.). In our experience, it is hard to get more than one review on a pull request - two is great. You can set up GitHub branch protection to actually require a review before a pull request can be merged! We recommend this. This step seems daunting to some hopefully under-resourced ontologies, but we recommend to put this high up on your list of priorities - train a colleague, reach out! 9. Merge and cleanup When the QC is green and the reviews are in (approvals), it is time to merge the pull request. After the pull request is merged, remember to delete the branch as well (this option will show up as a big button right after you have merged the pull request). If you have not done so, close all the associated tickets fixed by the pull request. 10. Changelog (Optional) It is sometimes difficult to keep track of changes made to an ontology. Some ontology teams opt to document changes in a changelog (simply a text file in your repository) so that when release day comes, you know everything you have changed. This is advisable at least for major changes (such as a new release system, a new pattern or template etc.).","title":"Editors Workflow"},{"location":"odk-workflows/EditorsWorkflow/#editors-workflow","text":"The editors workflow is one of the formal workflows to ensure that the ontology is developed correctly according to ontology engineering principles.

Run a release with the ODK Preparation: Ensure that all your pull requests are merged into your main (master) branch Make sure that all changes to master are committed to GitHub ( git status should say that there are no modified files) Locally make sure you have the latest changes from master ( git pull ) Checkout a new branch (e.g. git checkout -b release-2021-01-01 ) You may or may not want to refresh your imports as part of your release strategy (see here ) Make sure you have the latest ODK installed by running docker pull obolibrary/odkfull To actually run the release, you: Open a command line terminal window and navigate to the src/ontology directory ( cd vbo/src/ontology ) Run release pipeline: sh run.sh make prepare_release -B . Note that for some ontologies, this process can take up to 90 minutes - especially if there are large ontologies you depend on, like PRO or CHEBI. If everything went well, you should see the following output on your machine: Release files are now in ../.. - now you should commit, push and make a release on your git hosting site such as GitHub or GitLab . This will create all the specified release targets (OBO, OWL, JSON, and the variants, ont-full and ont-base) and copy them into your release directory (the top level of your repo). Review the release (Optional) Rough check. This step is frequently skipped, but for the more paranoid among us (like the author of this doc), this is a 3 minute additional effort for some peace of mind. Open the main release (vbo.owl) in you favourite development environment (i.e. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9) and eyeball the hierarchy. We recommend two simple checks: Does the very top level of the hierarchy look ok? This means that all new terms have been imported/updated correctly. Does at least one change that you know should be in this release appear? For example, a new class. This means that the release was actually based on the recent edit file. Commit your changes to the branch and make a pull request In your GitHub pull request, review the following three files in detail (based on our experience): vbo.obo - this reflects a useful subset of the whole ontology (everything that can be covered by OBO format). OBO format has that speaking for it: it is very easy to review! vbo-base.owl - this reflects the asserted axioms in your ontology that you have actually edited. Ideally also take a look at vbo-full.owl , which may reveal interesting new inferences you did not know about. Note that the diff of this file is sometimes quite large. Like with every pull request, we recommend to always employ a second set of eyes when reviewing a PR! Merge the main branch Once your CI checks have passed, and your reviews are completed, you can now merge the branch into your main branch (don't forget to delete the branch afterwards - a big button will appear after the merge is finished). Create a GitHub release Go to your releases page on GitHub by navigating to your repository, and then clicking on releases (usually on the right, for example: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/vertebrate-breed-ontology/releases). Then click \"Draft new release\" As the tag version you need to choose the date on which your ontologies were build. You can find this, for example, by looking at the vbo.obo file and check the data-version: property. The date needs to be prefixed with a v , so, for example v2020-02-06 . You can write whatever you want in the release title, but we typically write the date again. The description underneath should contain a concise list of changes or term additions.

When you see error messages relating to large ontologies such as CHEBI, PRO, NCBITAXON, or Uberon, you should think of memory first, see here . Problems when using OBO format based tools Sometimes you will get cryptic error messages when using legacy tools using OBO format, such as the ontology release tool (OORT), which is also available as part of the ODK docker container. In these cases, you need to track down what axiom or annotation actually caused the breakdown. In our experience (in about 60% of the cases) the problem lies with duplicate annotations ( def , comment ) which are illegal in OBO. Here is an example recipe of how to deal with such a problem: If you get a message like make: *** [cl.Makefile:84: oort] Error 255 you might have a OORT error. To debug this, in your terminal enter sh run.sh make IMP=false PAT=false oort -B (assuming you are already in the ontology folder in your directory) This should show you where the error is in the log (eg multiple different definitions) WARNING: THE FIX BELOW IS NOT IDEAL, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO FIX UPSTREAM IF POSSIBLE Open vbo-edit.owl in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and find the offending term and delete all offending issue (e.g. delete ALL definition, if the problem was \"multiple def tags not allowed\") and save. *While this is not idea, as it will remove all definitions from that term, it will be added back again when the term is fixed in the ontology it was imported from and added back in.

The ODK Project Configuration Schema defines all possible parameters that can be used in this config YAML. Once you have made your changes, you can run the following to apply your changes to the repository: sh run.sh make update_repo There are a large number of options that can be set to configure your ODK, but we will only discuss a few of them here. NOTE for Windows users: You may get a cryptic failure such as Set Illegal Option - if the update script located in src/scripts/update_repo.sh was saved using Windows Line endings. These need to change to unix line endings. In Notepad++, for example, you can click on Edit->EOL Conversion->Unix LF to change this. Managing imports You can use the update repository workflow described on this page to perform the following operations to your imports: Add a new import Modify an existing import Remove an import you no longer want Customise an import We will discuss all these workflows in the following. Add new import To add a new import, you first edit your odk config as described above , adding an id to the product list in the import_group section (for the sake of this example, we assume you already import RO, and your goal is to also import GO): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go Note: our ODK file should only have one import_group which can contain multiple imports (in the products section). Next, you run the update repo workflow to apply these changes. Note that by default, this module is going to be a SLME Bottom module, see here . To change that or customise your module, see section \"Customise an import\". To finalise the addition of your import, perform the following steps: Add an import statement to your src/ontology/vbo-edit.owl file. We suggest to do this using a text editor, by simply copying an existing import declaration and renaming it to the new ontology import, for example as follows: ... Ontology(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo.owl> Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/ro_import.owl>) Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/go_import.owl>) ... Add your imports redirect to your catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml , for example: <uri name=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> Test whether everything is in order: Refresh your import Open in your Ontology Editor of choice (Protege) and ensure that the expected terms are imported. Note: The catalog file src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml has one purpose: redirecting imports from URLs to local files. For example, if you have Import(<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/go_import.owl>) in your editors file (the ontology) and <uri name=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/go_import.owl\" uri=\"imports/go_import.owl\"/> in your catalog, tools like robot or Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 will recognize the statement in the catalog file to redirect the URL http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo/imports/go_import.owl to the local file imports/go_import.owl (which is in your src/ontology directory). Modify an existing import If you simply wish to refresh your import in light of new terms, see here . If you wish to change the type of your module see section \"Customise an import\". Remove an existing import To remove an existing import, perform the following steps: remove the import declaration from your src/ontology/vbo-edit.owl . remove the id from your src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml , eg. - id: go from the list of products in the import_group . run update repo workflow delete the associated files manually: src/imports/go_import.owl src/imports/go_terms.txt Remove the respective entry from the src/ontology/catalog-v001.xml file. Customise an import By default, an import module extracted from a source ontology will be a SLME module, see here . There are various options to change the default. The following change to your repo config ( src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml ) will switch the go import from an SLME module to a simple ROBOT filter module: import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: filter A ROBOT filter module is, essentially, importing all external terms declared by your ontology (see here on how to declare external terms to be imported). Note that the filter module does not consider terms/annotations from namespaces other than the base-namespace of the ontology itself. For example, in the example of GO above, only annotations / axioms related to the GO base IRI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_) would be considered. This behaviour can be changed by adding additional base IRIs as follows: import_group: products: - id: go module_type: filter base_iris: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_ - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO If you wish to customise your import entirely, you can specify your own ROBOT command to do so. To do that, add the following to your repo config ( src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml ): import_group: products: - id: ro - id: go module_type: custom Now add a new goal in your custom Makefile ( src/ontology/vbo.Makefile , not src/ontology/Makefile ). imports/go_import.owl: mirror/ro.owl imports/ro_terms_combined.txt if [ $(IMP) = true ]; then $(ROBOT) query -i $< --update ../sparql/preprocess-module.ru \\ extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ query --update ../sparql/inject-subset-declaration.ru --update ../sparql/postprocess-module.ru \\ annotate --ontology-iri $(ONTBASE)/$@ $(ANNOTATE_ONTOLOGY_VERSION) --output $@.tmp.owl && mv $@.tmp.owl $@; fi Now feel free to change this goal to do whatever you wish it to do! It probably makes some sense (albeit not being a strict necessity), to leave most of the goal instead and replace only: extract -T imports/ro_terms_combined.txt --force true --individuals exclude --method BOT \\ to another ROBOT pipeline. Add a component A component is an import which belongs to your ontology, e.g. is managed by you and your team. Open src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml If you dont have it yet, add a new top level section components Under the components section, add a new section called products . This is where all your components are specified Under the products section, add a new component, e.g. - filename: mycomp.owl Example components: products: - filename: mycomp.owl When running sh run.sh make update_repo , a new file src/ontology/components/mycomp.owl will be created which you can edit as you see fit. Typical ways to edit: Using a ROBOT template to generate the component (see below) Manually curating the component separately with Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or any other editor Providing a components/mycomp.owl: make target in src/ontology/vbo.Makefile and provide a custom command to generate the component WARNING : Note that the custom rule to generate the component MUST NOT depend on any other ODK-generated file such as seed files and the like (see issue ). Providing an additional attribute for the component in src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml , source , to specify that this component should simply be downloaded from somewhere on the web. Adding a new component based on a ROBOT template Since ODK 1.3.2, it is possible to simply link a ROBOT template to a component without having to specify any of the import logic. In order to add a new component that is connected to one or more template files, follow these steps: Open src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml . Make sure that use_templates: TRUE is set in the global project options. You should also make sure that use_context: TRUE is set in case you are using prefixes in your templates that are not known to robot , such as OMOP: , CPONT: and more. All non-standard prefixes you are using should be added to config/context.json . Add another component to the products section. To activate this component to be template-driven, simply say: use_template: TRUE . This will create an empty template for you in the templates directory, which will automatically be processed when recreating the component (e.g. run.bat make recreate-mycomp ). If you want to use more than one component, use the templates field to add as many template names as you wish. ODK will look for them in the src/templates directory. Advanced: If you want to provide additional processing options, you can use the template_options field. This should be a string with option from robot template . One typical example for additional options you may want to provide is --add-prefixes config/context.json to ensure the prefix map of your context is provided to robot , see above. Example : components: products: - filename: mycomp.owl use_template: TRUE template_options: --add-prefixes config/context.json templates: - template1.tsv - template2.tsv Note : if your mirror is particularly large and complex, read this ODK recommendation .","title":"Manage your ODK Repository"},{"location":"odk-workflows/RepoManagement/#managing-your-odk-repository","text":"","title":"Managing your ODK repository"},{"location":"odk-workflows/RepoManagement/#updating-your-odk-repository","text":"Your ODK repositories configuration is managed in src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml .

If you are looking to customise imports, like changing the module type, see here . Importing a new term Note: some ontologies now use a merged-import system to manage dynamic imports, for these please follow instructions in the section title \"Using the Base Module approach\". Importing a new term is split into two sub-phases: Declaring the terms to be imported Refreshing imports dynamically Declaring terms to be imported There are three ways to declare terms that are to be imported from an external ontology. Choose the appropriate one for your particular scenario (all three can be used in parallel if need be): Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration Using term files Using the custom import template Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-based declaration This workflow is to be avoided, but may be appropriate if the editor does not have access to the ODK docker container . This approach also applies to ontologies that use base module import approach. Open your ontology (edit file) in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (5.5+). Select 'owl:Thing' Add a new class as usual. Paste the full iri in the 'Name:' field, for example, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_50906. Click 'OK' Now you can use this term for example to construct logical definitions. The next time the imports are refreshed (see how to refresh here ), the metadata (labels, definitions, etc.) for this term are imported from the respective external source ontology and becomes visible in your ontology. Using term files Every import has, by default a term file associated with it, which can be found in the imports directory. For example, if you have a GO import in src/ontology/go_import.owl , you will also have an associated term file src/ontology/go_terms.txt . You can add terms in there simply as a list: GO:0008150 GO:0008151 Now you can run the refresh imports workflow ) and the two terms will be imported. Using the custom import template This workflow is appropriate if: You prefer to manage all your imported terms in a single file (rather than multiple files like in the \"Using term files\" workflow above). You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file . Refresh imports If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added. Note: You must have docker installed . sh run.sh make PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Since ODK 1.2.27, it is also possible to simply run the following, which is the same as the above: sh run.sh make refresh-go Note that in case you changed the defaults, you need to add IMP=true and/or MIR=true to the command below: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=true PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B If you wish to skip refreshing the mirror, i.e. skip downloading the latest version of the source ontology for your import (e.g. go.owl for your go import) you can set MIR=false instead, which will do the exact same thing as the above, but is easier to remember: sh run.sh make IMP=true MIR=false PAT=false imports/go_import.owl -B Using the Base Module approach Since ODK 1.2.31, we support an entirely new approach to generate modules: Using base files. The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it . A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this: Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology: Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms: Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 I.e. Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Gets removed. The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies. This is solved by _first merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it. Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we 1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module imports/merged_import.owl The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml. To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml to see if use_base_merging: TRUE is declared under import_group If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you) Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then refresh imports by running sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer. A solution would be to create a ticket in an issue tracker requesting for the term to be imported, and one of the local devs should pick this up and run the import for you. Lastly, restart Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the term should be imported in ready to be used.","title":"Imports management"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#update-imports-workflow","text":"This page discusses how to update the contents of your imports, like adding or removing terms.

You wish to augment your imported ontologies with additional information. This requires a cautionary discussion. To enable this workflow, you add the following to your ODK config file ( src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml ), and update the repository : use_custom_import_module: TRUE Now you can manage your imported terms directly in the custom external terms template, which is located at src/templates/external_import.owl . Note that this file is a ROBOT template , and can, in principle, be extended to include any axioms you like. Before extending the template, however, read the following carefully. The main purpose of the custom import template is to enable the management off all terms to be imported in a centralised place. To enable that, you do not have to do anything other than maintaining the template. So if you, say currently import APOLLO_SV:00000480 , and you wish to import APOLLO_SV:00000532 , you simply add a row like this: ID Entity Type ID TYPE APOLLO_SV:00000480 owl:Class APOLLO_SV:00000532 owl:Class When the imports are refreshed see imports refresh workflow , the term(s) will simply be imported from the configured ontologies. Now, if you wish to extend the Makefile (which is beyond these instructions) and add, say, synonyms to the imported terms, you can do that, but you need to (a) preserve the ID and ENTITY columns and (b) ensure that the ROBOT template is valid otherwise, see here . WARNING . Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue ). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong. However, since people are doing it, whether the OBO Foundry likes it or not, at least using the custom imports module as described here localises the changes to a single simple template and ensures that none of the annotations added this way are merged into the base file .","title":"Using the custom import template"},{"location":"odk-workflows/UpdateImports/#refresh-imports","text":"If you want to refresh the import yourself (this may be necessary to pass the travis tests), and you have the ODK installed, you can do the following (using go as an example): First, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then, you regenerate the import that will now include any new terms you have added.

The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it . A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this: Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology: Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms: Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123 Axiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123 I.e. Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124 Gets removed. The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies. This is solved by _first merging all mirrors into one huge file and then extracting one mega module from it. Example: Let's say we are importing terms from Uberon, GO and RO in our ontologies. When we use the base pipelines, we 1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module imports/merged_import.owl The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml. To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/vbo-odk.yaml to see if use_base_merging: TRUE is declared under import_group If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you) Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory). cd src/ontology Then refresh imports by running sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer. A solution would be to create a ticket in an issue tracker requesting for the term to be imported, and one of the local devs should pick this up and run the import for you. Lastly, restart Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and the term should be imported in ready to be used.","title":"Using the Base Module approach"},{"location":"odk-workflows/components/","text":"Adding components to an ODK repo For details on what components are, please see component section of repository file structure document .

VBO Term Label Term labels are unique and follow the format: - 'Most common name (Species)\u2019 in which Species is the English name (e.g. 'Chihuahua (Dog)' (VBO:0200338)). - 'Most common name, Country; (Species)' in which Country and Species are the English names. (e.g., \u2018Jersey Giant, Canada (Chicken)\u2019 (VBO:0006068)). This format is used for breeds defined by their country of existence as reported by FAO National Coordinators in DAD-IS. See more explanation in the term labels and naming conventions section. Exact synonym Any name that is provided by breed sources that represents the same concept as the VBO term is added as an exact synonym.

Database cross-reference is in the CURIE format Example: \u2018Angus (Cattle)\u2019 (VBO:0000104) has database_cross_reference LBO:0000017. The \u201csource\u201d annotation for the database cross reference is the provenance for this mapping between VBO and the other source. Currently, the provenance is the ORCID of the contributor [link to contributor section] who manually curated this mapping. Source VBO was created based on information available in breed communities, international breed organizations, literature, and personal communication with experts. We keep the provenance of all this information in the \u201csource\u201d annotation. This \u201csource\u201d annotation property can be used to annotate metadata and SubClass axioms. When used as an annotation to the term, \u201csource\u201d represents the provenance of any information about the VBO term. \"Source\" can refer to - a specific record in a database or other ontology - e.g. 'Abyssinian (Horse)' (VBO:0017087) has source LBO:0000714 - a publication - e.g. 'Spanish Jennet (Horse)' (VBO:0016895) has source ISBN:9781403966216 - an international breed organization - e.g. 'Schnauzer, Standard (Dog)' (VBO:0201189) has source https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/standard-schnauzer/ - individual experts - e.g. 'G\u00f6ttingen minipig (Pig)' (VBO:0016899) has source for exact synonym \u2018Goettingen miniature pig\u2019 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-6597 Contributor Curators and experts who contributed to the creation of a VBO term are recorded by adding their ORCID, using the annotation property \u201cdcterms:contributor\u201d.

These codes are used on registration papers and for competition purposes. Breed codes are therefore of importance for some users. The same codes are often, though not always, reused between communities. We recorded breed code as annotations using the annotation property \u201cbreed code\u201d. Since codes are not always the same across communities, the source for the breed codes are recorded. Example: 'Abyssinian (Cat)' (VBO:0100000) is known by the breed code, \u2018AB\u2019 by TICA and \u2018ABY\u2019 by several other cat organizations, FIFe, WCF, GCCF and REFR. Breed recognition status We took an inclusive approach and created a VBO term when \u201cany\u201d sources described a group of animal as a breed. However, what is considered a \u201cbreed\u201d can vary between these sources, and this breed recognition can be of importance to some communities. For example, only breeds officially recognized by registration bodies determine eligibility of an animal to compete in a championship. We recorded the breed recognition status in VBO as an annotation, using the annotation property \u2018breed_recognition_status\u2019 , and a VBO \u2018recognition status\u2019 (VBO:0300001) term. These \u2018recognition status\u2019 terms could be: VBO terms Term labels Definitions VBO:0300002 fully recognized breed Breed recognition status referring to a breed recognized by an international registration body. This status also refers to breeds that are eligible to compete in championship classes. VBO:0300003 partially recognized breed Breed recognition status referring to a breed that is in the process of becoming fully recognized by an international registration body. This status is given to breeds which are preliminarily or provisionally recognized. VBO:0300004 not recognized breed Breed recognition status referring to a breed that is reported by an international registration body but not recognized. It should be noted that a same breed could have more than one \u2018breed recognition status\u2019 depending on the provenance of the information. All current available information is recorded in VBO , and provenance for this ingormation is recorded as a \u201csource\u201d annotation. This following example is a breed with multiple \u201cbreed recognition status\u201d: Domestication status The definition of Vertebrate Breed [REF] in VBO implies that a group of animals can be considered as a breed regardless of their domestication status. This domestication status can be of importance in some communities, for example in DAD-IS and the FAO, therefore, we recorded that information when available. We recorded the breed domestication status in VBO as an annotation, using the annotation property \u2018has_domestication_status\u2019. The domestication status can be one of the following terms: VBO terms Term labels Definitions VBO:0300006 feral breed Domestication status given to a group of animals that has been domesticated and has adapted to existence in the wild state but remains distinct from other wild individuals of the same species. VBO:0300007 domestic breed Domestication status given to a group of animals that has been domesticated, that is have been selectively bred and genetically adapted over generations to live alongside humans. VBO:0300008 wild breed Domestication status given to a group of animals that has not been domesticated and exists as free-living, self-sustaining and unmanaged population. As with all metadata, the source of information is recorded. Currently, the domestication status information solely comes from DAD-IS. Examples: Extinction status upcoming Description of origin Information about the breed origin, including information about the foundation stock used to create a breed, is often available in the form of free text notes. The free text note format is not ideal for querying information, but since this information is useful to some users, we recorded it, as reported by the sources (i.e. in free text note format), using the annotation property \u201cdescription of origin\u201d (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vbo#origindescription). As for all other metadata, the source for the information is included. It should be noted that - ongoing work aims to review the \u2018description of origin\u2019 information and create \u2018has_foundation_stock\u2019 axioms to record this information in a more semantically useful format - some information beyond the description of origin is sometimes included. Comment Information on term concepts and usage are provided in the comment. Example: In subset - transboundary Users requested a way to identify VBO terms corresponding to DAD-IS transboundary breeds (read more about transboundary breeds and DAD-IS HERE). To support users of the DAD-IS data, we added a subset annotation to these VBO terms. The annotation uses the \u201cin subset\u201d (http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#inSubset) annotation property, with the \u201ctransboundary\u201d annotation. Example: Term tracker All ontology updates are tracked in our GitHub repository . When an update or edit on a VBO term is made in the context of a GitHub issue, a link to GitHub issue is added the VBO term. These links are useful to keep track of editing history (e.g. what changes were made) and for transparency (i.e. one can go back to a GitHub issue to gain context on the discussions and decisions that lead to the changes in the VBO term).","title":"VBO term Metadata"},{"location":"ontologymodeling/metadata/#vbo-term-metadata","text":"VBO terms have rich metadata, all associated with provenance.

In addition, the same name is often used to refer to different breeds, of different species. For example, \u201cTibetan\u201d is the name for a breed of cattle, sheep, chicken, pig, goat, etc. Some breeds are also commonly called by names that can represent other types of entities. For example \u201cCyprus\u201d is used to refer to breeds of cattle, cat, etc., but also to the country \u201cCyprus\u201d. A VBO term label must be unique, i.e. multiple terms cannot have the same label, even if their names are the same. In this document, we explain how VBO term labels were created to ensure uniqueness and uniformity. To create unique VBO term labels, we concatenated the breed\u2019s most common name and their species, following the format: **'Most common name (Species)'** , in which most common name and species are the English language names (e.g. 'Cyprus (Cat)' VBO:0100081). The \u201cMost common name\u201d represents the breed name that is most often used to refer to the breed, as determined by the information found in the sources ( LINK to be added ). This \u2018most common name\u2019 is also recorded as an \u201cexact synonym\u201d [ LINK to be added ]. All breed names, including the one that are shared between breeds, are available as synonyms in VBO. For example, an exact synonym of Tibetan (Goat) VBO:0000845 is Tibetan. Including the \u2018Species\u2019 in the term label could be controversial. Breeds have a is_a relationship to a species, and therefore repeating the species name (i.e., ontological parentage) in the label is a break with standard ontology practices. While we recognize that this solution is not ideal, we were unable to ensure term label uniqueness without including the species name in the term label. As exemplified above, breeds from different species can share the same name, and some breeds can share identical name with other types of entities such as countries. The case of DAD-IS \u201cnational breed population\u201d and \u201clocal breeds\u201d. DAD-IS is maintained by National Coordinators for the Management of Animal Genetic Resources, and therefore their concept of breed is closely tight to the country where a breed has been reported (read more about DAD-IS here ). DAD-IS distinguishes between: - \u201cnational breed population\u201d which refers to the existence of a particular breed in a particular country. For example, a breed of chicken called \u201cAlatau\u201d reported to exist in Kyrgyzstan (VBO:0007427) - \u201clocal breed\u201d which refers to a country specific instance of a same breed that exists in each of several countries (itself called \u201ctransboundary\u201d breed). (see example below) As a consequence, it is very common to find breeds in DAD-IS with the same common name and from the same species. For example, \u201cJersey Giant\u201d is a breed of chicken that exists in Canada, Ireland, Luxembourg, etc., with each instance of this breed in an individual county being considered as an individual breed record to be represented in VBO. The naming convention reported above, based on \u201cmost common name\u201d and \u201cspecies\u201d is therefore not sufficient to ensure term label uniqueness for DAD-IS \u201cnational breed population\u201d and \u201clocal breed\u201d. The country where the breed has been reported by the National Coordinators had to be included to the VBO term label, following the format: **'Most common name\u2019, Country (Species)'** , in which country and species are the English names (e.g \u2018Jersey Giant, Canada (Chicken)\u2019 VBO:0006068). We recognize that adding the country of existence in the term name, in addition to the species, is not ideal and is unusual to ontology practices, but this concatenation of attributes was the only viable solution to ensure term uniqueness.","title":"Label and Naming Conventions"},{"location":"ontologymodeling/term-labels-naming-conventions/#term-labels-and-naming-conventions","text":"One can refer to the same breed by multiple names, including names in different languages (e.g. \u2018Artois Hound\u2019 and \u2018Chien d\u2019Artois\u2019 refer to the same breed).

For example \u201cCyprus\u201d is used to refer to breeds of cattle, cat, etc., but also to the country \u201cCyprus\u201d. A VBO term label must be unique, i.e. multiple terms cannot have the same label, even if their names are the same. In this document, we explain how VBO term labels were created to ensure uniqueness and uniformity. To create unique VBO term labels, we concatenated the breed\u2019s most common name and their species, following the format: **'Most common name (Species)'** , in which most common name and species are the English language names (e.g. 'Cyprus (Cat)' VBO:0100081). The \u201cMost common name\u201d represents the breed name that is most often used to refer to the breed, as determined by the information found in the sources ( LINK to be added ). This \u2018most common name\u2019 is also recorded as an \u201cexact synonym\u201d [ LINK to be added ]. All breed names, including the one that are shared between breeds, are available as synonyms in VBO. For example, an exact synonym of Tibetan (Goat) VBO:0000845 is Tibetan. Including the \u2018Species\u2019 in the term label could be controversial. Breeds have a is_a relationship to a species, and therefore repeating the species name (i.e., ontological parentage) in the label is a break with standard ontology practices. While we recognize that this solution is not ideal, we were unable to ensure term label uniqueness without including the species name in the term label. As exemplified above, breeds from different species can share the same name, and some breeds can share identical name with other types of entities such as countries. The case of DAD-IS \u201cnational breed population\u201d and \u201clocal breeds\u201d. DAD-IS is maintained by National Coordinators for the Management of Animal Genetic Resources, and therefore their concept of breed is closely tight to the country where a breed has been reported (read more about DAD-IS here ). DAD-IS distinguishes between: - \u201cnational breed population\u201d which refers to the existence of a particular breed in a particular country. For example, a breed of chicken called \u201cAlatau\u201d reported to exist in Kyrgyzstan (VBO:0007427) - \u201clocal breed\u201d which refers to a country specific instance of a same breed that exists in each of several countries (itself called \u201ctransboundary\u201d breed). (see example below) As a consequence, it is very common to find breeds in DAD-IS with the same common name and from the same species. For example, \u201cJersey Giant\u201d is a breed of chicken that exists in Canada, Ireland, Luxembourg, etc., with each instance of this breed in an individual county being considered as an individual breed record to be represented in VBO. The naming convention reported above, based on \u201cmost common name\u201d and \u201cspecies\u201d is therefore not sufficient to ensure term label uniqueness for DAD-IS \u201cnational breed population\u201d and \u201clocal breed\u201d. The country where the breed has been reported by the National Coordinators had to be included to the VBO term label, following the format: **'Most common name\u2019, Country (Species)'** , in which country and species are the English names (e.g \u2018Jersey Giant, Canada (Chicken)\u2019 VBO:0006068). We recognize that adding the country of existence in the term name, in addition to the species, is not ideal and is unusual to ontology practices, but this concatenation of attributes was the only viable solution to ensure term uniqueness.","title":"Term labels and Naming Conventions"},{"location":"ontologymodeling/xref/","text":"VBO Database Cross-References Documentation upcoming","title":"Database Cross-References"},{"location":"ontologymodeling/xref/#vbo-database-cross-references","text":"Documentation upcoming","title":"VBO Database Cross-References"}]}
