VBO:0300009	extinction status	VBO:0300000	Breed status refering to the risk of extinction of a breed. A breed risk of extinction depends on the breeding population including population size (ie the number of living animals belonging to a breed), number of breeding females and males, and population trends (ie decreasing, stable, or increasing population), the reproductive capacity of the breed (ie the time required to produce a new generation of breeding animals, and the number of offspring produced in a limited amount of time), and the existence of active conservation programs.	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-7153|https://www.fao.org/dad-is	Risk of extinction is determined using matrix based on the breeding population and reproductive capacity of the breed (https://www.fao.org/dad-is). It should be noted that the extinction risk criteria might differ between the international breed organizations. 
VBO:0300010	not at risk of extinction	VBO:0300009	Extinction status given to a group of animals in which the number of breeding males and/or females is sufficient to maintain the existence of the breed. 	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-7153|https://www.fao.org/dad-is	
VBO:0300011	at risk of extinction	VBO:0300009	Extinction status given to a group of animals in which the breeding population (ie number of breeding males and/or females, and/or the number of living animals belonging to a breed) is reduced to a level that is threatening the existence of the breed. 	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-7153	
VBO:0300012	extinct	VBO:0300009	Extinction status given to a group of animals in which no breeding males and/or females remains, and for which any cryoconserved genetic material that may be available is insufficient for breed reconstitution.	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-7153|https://www.fao.org/dad-is	
VBO:0300013	cryoconserved only	VBO:0300009	Extinction status given to a group of animals that has no living male or female animals remaining, but for which there is sufficient cryopreserved genetic material to allow for reconstitution of the breed.	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4142-7153|https://www.fao.org/dad-is
